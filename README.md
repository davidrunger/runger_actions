# Installation

Add the gem to your application's `Gemfile`. Because the gem is not released via RubyGems, you will
need to install it from GitHub.

```rb
gem 'runger_actions', git: 'https://github.com/davidrunger/runger_actions.git'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

# Usage in general

## Setup

Create a new subdirectory within the `app/` directory in your Rails app: `app/actions/`.

Create an `app/actions/application_action.rb` file with this content:
```rb
# app/actions/application_action.rb

class ApplicationAction < RungerActions::Base
end
```

## Generate your actions

This gem provides a Rails generator. For example, running:

```
bin/rails g runger_actions:action Users::Create
```

will create an empty action in `app/actions/users/create.rb`.

## Define your actions

Then, you can start defining actions. Here's an example:
```rb
# app/actions/send_text_message.rb

class SendTextMessage < ApplicationAction
  requires :message_body, String, length: { minimum: 3 } # don't send any super short messages
  requires :user, User do
    validates :phone, presence: true, format: { with: /[[:digit:]]{11}/ }
  end

  returns :cost, Float, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0 }
  returns :nexmo_id, String, presence: true

  fails_with :nexmo_request_failed

  def execute
    nexmo_response = NexmoClient.send_text!(number: user.phone, message: message_body)
    if nexmo_response.success?
      nexmo_response_data = nexmo_response.parsed_response
      result.cost = nexmo_response_data['cost']
      result.nexmo_id = nexmo_response_data['message-id']
    else
      result.nexmo_request_failed!
    end
  end
end
```

## Invoke your actions

Once you have defined one or more actions, you can invoke the action(s) anywhere in your code, such
as in a controller, as illustrated below.

```rb
# app/controllers/api/text_messages_controller.rb

class Api::TextMessagesController < ApplicationController
  def create
    send_message_action =
      SendTextMessage.new(
        user: current_user,
        message_body: "Hello! This message was generated at #{Time.current}.",
      )

    if !send_message_action.valid?
      # We'll enter this block if one of the ActiveRecord inputs (`user`, in this case) for the
      # action doesn't meet the required validations, e.g. if the user's `phone` is blank.
      render json: { error: send_message_action.errors.full_messages.join(', ') }, status: 400
      return
    end

    result = send_message_action.run
    if result.success?
      Rails.logger.info("Sent message with Nexmo id #{result.nexmo_id} at a cost of #{result.cost}")
      head :created
    elsif result.nexmo_request_failed?
      render json: { error: 'An error occurred when sending the text message' }, status: 500
    end
  end
end
```

You aren't limited to invoking actions from a controller action, though; you can invoke an action
from anywhere in your code.

One good place to invoke an action is from within *another* action. For a complex or multi-step
process, you might want to break that process down into several "sub actions" that can be invoked
from the `#execute` method of a coordinating "parent action".

### Available methods

There are a few different methods that can be used to instantiate and/or run an action:
1. `::run!` class method
2. `::new!` class method
3. `::new` class method
4. `#run!` instance method
5. `#run` instance method

#### `::run!` class method

This will attempt to instantiate an action (via `::new!`) and then attempt to run the action (via `#run!`). If there are any validation errors and/or if any `fails_with` conditions are invoked during execution, then an error will be raised.

Example:
```rb
SendTextMessage.run!(user: current_user, message_body: 'Hello!')
```

#### `::new!` class method

This will attempt to instantiate an action. If there are any validation errors, then an error will be raised.

Example:
```rb
action = SendTextMessage.new!(user: current_user, message_body: 'Hi!')
```

#### `::new` class method

This will instantiate an action. Even if there are ActiveModel validation errors, an error will **not** be raised.

Example:
```rb
action = SendTextMessage.new(user: current_user, message_body: 'Hi!')
```

#### `#run!` instance method

This will attempt to run an action. If any `fails_with` conditions are invoked during execution, then an error will be raised.

Example:
```rb
action = SendTextMessage.new!(user: current_user, message_body: 'Hi!')
action.run!
```

#### `#run` instance method

This will run an action. If any `fails_with` conditions are invoked during execution, then an error will **not** be raised. The errors will be registered on the `result` object.

Example:
```rb
action = SendTextMessage.new!(user: current_user, message_body: 'Hi!')
result = action.run
result.nexmo_request_failed? # check if a `fails_with` condition was invoked
```

# Usage in specific

## An `#execute` instance method is required!

The only real requirement for an action is that it implements an `#execute` instance method.

```rb
class DoSomething < ApplicationAction
  def execute
    # you MUST write an #execute instance method for your action
  end
end
```

Although all actions must implement an `#execute` instance method, you should generally not invoke
that method directly in your application code. Instead, call `#run` on an instance of the class:

```rb
# this will run the DoSomething#execute instance method
DoSomething.new.run
```

## Action class methods

When defining an action class, these three class methods are available:
1. `requires`
2. `returns`
3. `fails_with`

Those class methods are all optional, though. We'll detail/illustrate their usage below.

### `::requires`

The `::requires` class method declares the necessary, expected inputs that are needed in order to
execute an action.

An action can have zero, one, or more `requires` statements.

An action that requires no input values will have no `requires` statements:

```rb
class PrintCurrentTime < ApplicationAction
  def execute
    puts("The current time is #{Time.now}.")
  end
end

PrintCurrentTime.new.run
# => prints "The current time is 2020-06-20 03:25:14 -0700."
```

Most actions probably will take one or more inputs, though. Here's an example of an action with one
`requires` statement:

```rb
class PrintDoubledNumber < ApplicationAction
  requires :number, Numeric

  def execute
    puts("#{number} doubled is #{number * 2}")
  end
end

PrintDoubledNumber.new(number: 8).run
# => prints "8 doubled is 16"
```

In the example above, because the `PrintDoubledNumber` action class declares `requires :number`, a
`#number` instance method is available for all instances of that action class. This `#number`
instance method is used within the `PrintDoubledNumber#execute` action.

All subsequent arguments given to `requires` are used to define a "shape" via the [`shaped`
gem](https://github.com/davidrunger/shaped/).

The simplest way to define the expected "shape" of a required action parameter is probably to
declare its expected class, as illustrated above (where we specified that the `number` input
parameter must be an instance of `Numeric`). However, the `shaped` gem supports a wide variety of
ways to specify the expected "shape" of an input. A few additional examples are shown below; see the
[`shaped` documentation](https://github.com/davidrunger/shaped/) for more possibilities.

#### Specifying the expected shape of a Hash input

```rb
class PrintNameAndEmail < ApplicationAction
  # The `{ email: String, phone: String }` argument specifies the expected shape of `user_data`.
  requires :user_data, { name: String, email: String }

  def execute
    puts("The email of #{user_data[:name]} is #{user_data[:email]}.")
  end
end

PrintNameAndEmail.new(user_data: { name: 'Tom', email: 'tommy@example.com' }).run
# => prints "The email of Tom is tommy@example.com."

# The name and email keys are strings; they are supposed to be symbols.
PrintNameAndEmail.new(user_data: { 'name' => 'Thomas', 'email' => 'tommy@example.com' })
# => raises RungerActions::TypeMismatch

# The `:name` key is missing in the `user_data` hash.
PrintNameAndEmail.new(user_data: { email: 'tommy@example.com' })
# => raises RungerActions::TypeMismatch
```

#### Specifying ActiveModel-style validations

```rb
class PrintEmail < ApplicationAction
  requires :email, String, format: { with: /.+@.+\..+/ }, length: { minimum: 6 }

  def execute
    puts("The email is '#{email}'.")
  end
end

PrintEmail.new(email: 'jefferson@example.com').run
# => prints "The email is 'jefferson@example.com'."

# This email doesn't match the specified regex
PrintEmail.new(email: 'Thomas Jefferson')
# => raises RungerActions::TypeMismatch

# This email is too short
PrintEmail.new(email: 'a@b.c')
# => raises RungerActions::TypeMismatch
```

#### Specifying arbitrary input "shapes" by providing a callable object

You can leverage `shaped`'s [`Callable` shape
type](https://github.com/davidrunger/shaped/#shapedshapescallable) by providing any object that
responds to `#call` (such as a lambda). This allows you unlimited flexibility to define requirements
for the action's input(s).

```rb
class PrintSmallEvenNumber < ApplicationAction
  requires :small_even_number, ->(number) { (0..6).cover?(number) && number.even? }

  def execute
    puts("#{small_even_number} is a small, even number.")
  end
end

PrintSmallEvenNumber.new(small_even_number: 2).run
# => prints "2 is a small, even number."

# This number is not even
PrintSmallEvenNumber.new(small_even_number: 3).run
# => raises RungerActions::TypeMismatch

# This number is not small
PrintSmallEvenNumber.new(small_even_number: 200).run
# => raises RungerActions::TypeMismatch
```

#### Specifying validations for ActiveRecord inputs

When declaring a `requires` where the input is specified (via the second argument to `requires`) to
be a class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base`, there are a few special things that happen:
1. You can provide a **validation block** for the ActiveRecord object. Within this block, you can
   specify validations on attributes of that ActiveRecord model.
2. You can check, by calling `valid?` on an instance of the action, whether the ActiveRecord
   object(s) that are inputs for the action meet the **validation block** validations.
3. You can access any validation errors (from the **validation block**) via the `#errors` method of
   the action instance.
4. You can execute the action instance via `run!` rather than `run`; this will raise an exception
   (and not run the `#execute` method) if any of the validations from a **validation block** are not
   met.

```rb
class PrintFirstAndLastName < ApplicationAction
  requires :user, User do
    validates :name, format: { with: /.+ .+/ }
  end

  def execute
    name_parts = user.name.split(' ')
    puts("First name: #{name_parts.first}. Last name: #{name_parts.last}")
  end
end

user = User.find(1)
user.is_a?(ActiveRecord::Base)
# => true
user.name
# => "David Runger"
action = PrintFirstAndLastName.new(user: user)
action.valid?
# => true
action.errors.to_hash
# => {}
action.run!
# => prints "First name: David. Last name: Runger"

user = User.find(2)
user.name
# => "Cher"
action = PrintFirstAndLastName.new(user: user)
action.valid?
# => false
action.errors.to_hash
# => {:name=>["is invalid"]}
action.run!
# => raises RungerActions::InvalidParam
```

### `::returns`

The `::returns` class method describes the value(s) that an action promises to return (if any).

As with `requires`, an action can have zero, one, or more `returns` statements.

An action that is used for its "side effects," such as most of the examples above that use `puts` to
print output, will probably not have any `returns` statements.

However, if you want the action to return object(s)/data to other parts of your code, then you'll
need to declare those return values using the `returns` class method.

Here's an example:

```rb
class MultiplyNumber < ApplicationAction
  requires :input_number, Numeric

  returns :doubled_number, Numeric
  returns :tripled_number, Numeric

  def execute
    result.doubled_number = input_number * 2
    result.tripled_number = input_number * 3
  end
end

multiply_result = MultiplyNumber.new(input_number: 1.5).run
multiply_result.class
# => MultiplyNumber::Result
puts("The number doubled is #{multiply_result.doubled_number}")
# => prints "The number doubled is 3.0"
puts("The number tripled is #{multiply_result.tripled_number}")
# => prints "The number tripled is 4.5"
```

#### The `result` object

We can see in the example above that `MultiplyNumber#execute` references `result`, which is an
object provided automatically to action instances. Because the `MultiplyNumber` action declares
`returns :doubled_number` and `returns :tripled_number`, the `result` object automatically has
`#doubled_number=` and `#tripled_number=` writer methods, which can (and should) be invoked by the
action instance in order to set those values on the `result` object.

When we call `MultiplyNumber.new(input_number: 1.5).run`, the return value of `#run` is the action's
`result` object. Outside of the action, we can then access the return values that were set within
the action's `#execute` method; we do this via the `#doubled_number` and `#tripled_number` reader
methods that are defined on the result object (which we captured in a local variable called
`multiply_result`).

#### All promised values must be returned

If an action fails to set any promised return values on the `result` object, then an error will be
raised when `#run` is called:

```rb
class MultiplyNumber < ApplicationAction
  requires :input_number, Numeric

  returns :doubled_number, Numeric
  returns :tripled_number, Numeric

  def execute
    # PROBLEM BELOW! An error will be raised when this action is executed,
    # because we fail to set a `doubled_number` return value.

    # result.doubled_number = input_number * 2
    result.tripled_number = input_number * 3
  end
end

multiply_result = MultiplyNumber.new(input_number: 10).run
# => raises RungerActions::MissingResultValue
```

#### Validating the "shape" of returned values

As with the `requires` action class method, the "shape" of the promised return values declared via
`returns` can be described via the arguments to `returns`, which are passed to the [`shaped`
gem](https://github.com/davidrunger/shaped/). Leveraging this functionality allows you to ensure
that your action is providing the expected type of return values.

```rb
class UppercaseEmail < ApplicationAction
  requires :email, String, format: { with: /.+@.+/ }

  returns :uppercased_email, String, format: { with: /[A-Z]+@[A-Z.]+/ }

  def execute
    result.uppercased_email = email.upcase
  end
end

UppercaseEmail.new(email: 'david@protonmail.com').run.uppercased_email
# => "DAVID@PROTONMAIL.COM"
```

If an action attempts to set a return value that doesn't match the specified "shape" for that return
value, then an `RungerActions::TypeMismatch` error will be raised:

```rb
class UppercaseEmail < ApplicationAction
  requires :email, String, format: { with: /.+@.+/ }

  returns :uppercased_email, String, format: { with: /[A-Z]+@[A-Z.]+/ }

  def execute
    # PROBLEM BELOW! This action is supposed to _upcase_ the email, not downcase it!
    result.uppercased_email = email.downcase
  end
end

UppercaseEmail.new(email: 'david@protonmail.com').run
# => raises RungerActions::TypeMismatch
```

### `::fails_with`

The `::fails_with` class method can be used to enumerate possible "failure modes" for the action.

As with `requires` and `returns`, an action can have zero, one, or more `fails_with` statements.

Generally, it's best to try to write actions in a way such that we don't expect any failures, but
sometimes there are things outside of our control; in such cases, using `fails_with` to list these
possible points of failure is a good idea. For example, a call to an external API might time out or
receive a 500 error response.

Here's a (contrived) example with one `fails_with` declaration:

```rb
class PrintRandomNumberAboveFive < ApplicationAction
  fails_with :number_was_too_small

  def execute
    random_number = rand(10)
    if random_number > 5
      puts(random_number)
    else
      result.number_was_too_small!
    end
  end
end

result = PrintRandomNumberAboveFive.new.run
# => prints "9" (sometimes)
result.success?
# => true
result.number_was_too_small?
# => false
```

In the case above, we didn't encounter the error condition, which we can verify via the `#success?`
and `#number_was_too_small?` methods on the result. `#success?` is available on all action results,
and `#number_was_too_small?` is available for this particular action result because the action class
declares `fails_with :number_was_too_small`.

And here's what a failure case would look like:

```rb
result = PrintRandomNumberAboveFive.new.run
# => [doesn't print anything, if the random number is <= 5]
result.success?
# => false
result.number_was_too_small?
# => true
```

In this case, we entered the `else` branch of the action's `#execute` method and called the
`result.number_was_too_small!` method (made available automatically because of the class's
`fails_with :number_was_too_small` declaration). Since we called the `result.number_was_too_small!`
method, indicating that that failure mode occurred when executing the action, `#success?` returns
`false` and `#number_was_too_small?` returns `true`.

#### Setting an `error_message`

When invoking a `fails_with` error case, the bang method can optionally take an error message as an
argument, which will then be made available via a special `error_message` reader on the result
object:

```rb
class SellAlcohol < ApplicationAction
  requires :age, Numeric

  fails_with :too_young

  def execute
    if age < 21
      result.too_young!("Age #{age} is too young to buy alcohol.")
    else
      puts('Enjoy your alcohol responsibly!')
    end
  end
end

result = SellAlcohol.new!(age: 17).run
result.success?
# => false
result.too_young?
# => true
result.error_message
# => "Age 17 is too young to buy alcohol."
```

# Status / Context

I wouldn't recommend using this gem in production. It's very new (i.e. probably rough around the
edges, subject to significant changes at a relatively rapid rate, and arguably somewhat feature
incomplete) and I am not committed to maintaing the gem.

I mostly built this gem because I wasn't _quite_ satisfied with any of the above alternatives that I
knew about at the time that I decided to start building it. I built this gem mostly to scratch my
own itch and for the sake of exploring this problem space a little bit.

I am actively using this gem in the small Rails application that hosts my personal website and apps;
you can check out its [`app/actions/`
directory](https://github.com/davidrunger/david_runger/tree/master/app/actions) if you are
interested in seeing some real-world use cases.

# Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rspec` to run
the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
